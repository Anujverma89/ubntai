# Troubleshoot : 
    1) Kernel error / Driver errors

# What else can we see in the package : 
1) Active processes in the system and packages using that.

# Different Log files : 
* All logs are present mostly in /var/log/
* Application installed from snap contains logs in snap/app/log
* For kernel logs run dmesg
* ~/.var/app/<app>/ for flatpack applications


# Add more feature : 
* Allow to see Failed login attems 
* Allow to see all the ports using net 
* Allow to see all the active ports in the system along with application name



# How Installation module will work : 
* User can search for any app 
* We will show where it is availalbe
* User can install by clicking over that app
### Snap packages : 
a) They have everything required to run inside them.
b) They include all dependencies.
c) So install directly using app 
### APT : 
### AppImage : 
* Runs on any linux distribution irrespective of the distribution.
* Download app from app image . 
* Make it executable and run the script ./app.appimage
* We won't facilitate app image because they are not centralized at one place.
### Ubuntu software center (App Store) 
### Flatpack 


# Lets apt : 
* It is a CLI frontend 

### Flow of installation package : 
* User Searches for package 
* Find the package
* See's where it is available 
* Now when use clicks on install/uninstall/ 
    * Open terminal behind the scenes.
    * Run the command on behalf of the user.
    * Shows the status.


* Reading installed applications
* applications installed using snap from /snap folder 
* 


# Checking for packages : 
* Binary Executables & System utilities : from usr/bin & /usr/sbin
* Applications : /snap,  /var/lib/flatpak/, 
* Libraries : /lib, /usr/lib / usr/share


# Types of files present in log folder : 
1) directory / can be found using isDir() return ture if dir()
2) .gz / to work on /
3) Log files / can be read easily 0 / can be found using isFile(); return true if file



# In a registration flow : 
    if user doesnot exists then only the new user is created and otp is sent else the user is logged in directly
